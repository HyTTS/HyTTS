# Security Policy

We take security seriously - thanks for helping to make HyTTS even more secure!

If you think you've found a security issue, please DO NOT report the issue publicly anywhere, including GitHub. 
Instead, contact us privately using GitHub's "new draf security advisory" feature in the project's "Security Advisories" page.
