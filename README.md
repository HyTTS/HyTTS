# HyperText TypeScript (HyTTS)

HyTTS (pronounced "heights") is a framework for server-side rendered web apps based on TypeScript.
It is inspired by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and its component-oriented, declarative nature, but uses server-side rendering instead, with SPA-like interactivity based on concepts found in [Turbo](https://hotwired.dev/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/).

HyTTS' goal is to reduce the complexity of modern-day web development while retaining the user and developer experience improvements achieved by the web development community in recent years.

## Project Status

HyTTS is currently under active development.
Things might change considerably in an effort to enhance the features set and to reduce the complexity of HyTTS' API and implementation to a minimum.
