# HyperText TypeScript (HyTTS)

HyTTS (pronounced "heights") is a full-stack web framework for server-side rendered web apps written in TypeScript.
End-to-end type safety from server code to browser code and back is one of its major design principles.
While HyTTS is heavily inspired by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and its JSX-based, component-oriented and declarative nature, it exclusively uses server-side rendering instead, with SPA-like interactivity based on concepts found in [Turbo](https://hotwired.dev/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/).

HyTTS' goal is to reduce the complexity of modern-day web development while retaining the user and developer experience improvements achieved by the web development community in recent years.

## Project Status

HyTTS is currently under active development after having completed a successful experimentation and prototyping phase.
In the coming months, things might change considerably in an effort to enhance the feature set and to reduce the complexity of HyTTS' API and implementation.

Thus, HyTTS is not yet ready for production use and does not have any documentation yet.
